       "      <td>so, some background information. i am a recent grad still looking for their first real salaried job. i'm an industrial designer, and i really want to work in the toy industry and be a toy designer, and maybe even a brand manager one day. the thing about the toy industry is that it is very small, and very competitive. with the two major companies (hasbro and mattel) having their pick of the litter when it comes to talent, finding openings there is tough. \\n\\nso rewind to graduation, i got a design internship at a major toy company. after the term of the internship was over they weren't in a position to hire anyone so they released me in to the world to find a real job. so, the office at this company was pretty casual. one of the female designers would sometimes wear fairly formal blouses and dresses, but the rest of the team would dress very casually. the most senior designer would regularly wear cargo shorts and a t-shirt to work, and the design manager (everyone's boss who reports directly to the ceo) would regularly wear t-shirts, torn, ripped jeans, and skater shoes. everyone else was fairly casual, but fell somewhere inbetween. i regularly dressed nicer than the average (button ups, khakis, ect) if for nothing else but to impress and not be the lowest common denominator. \\n\\nfast forward a few months, i've been working with a recruiter who specializes in the toy industry, and i had a very promising opportunity at a small company. several rounds of phone interviews went stellar, and they finally flew me out to atlanta for the big interview. now, somewhere along the way i remember either reading or being taught that wearing what you might normally wear to work to a job interview is usually acceptable. i have interviewed at other toy companies in person with this strategy and never seemed to have an issue (but never got the job either).  not wanting to seem stiff, i left the blazer at home and hit the airport wearing pretty much exactly what i would regularly wear as an intern. button up (with a small, fun but not casual repeating print of cactuses) khakis and some dope sneaks for some flair. \\n\\nso i walk into their reception area and look around and think to my self, *wow, it is really nice in here*. i instantly become self conscious because the office is way more formal than i was expecting from all my previous interviewing and work experience in the industry. i go into the interview desperately hoping i just come off as the young, energetic, fun designer they are looking for. i meet the design manager who will be my boss  for the first time in person (i would have been the 3rd member of the team), and we instantly hit it off. the interview is going very well and i never get any vibes from him that my clothes are unacceptable (he was wearing jeans). the interview is going super well, and the language starts to change from \"if you start\" to \"when you start\" and i am elated. he loves my work, my personality, and i like the product they make and immediately see many ways to help them develop it further (which is why they were hiring)\\n\\nthen a knock comes on the door. it's the coo. i knew he was going to be attending the interview at some point, but it had been almost an hour and a half before he shows up. in his words, he was checking for \"corporate and office fit\" and was leaving the talent and personality evaluation to the other guy since i would be working with him directly. he was wearing a purple long sleeve formal button up, with slacks and dress shoes. this portion of the interview goes well, and the design manager is visibly excited, telling the coo about me, and what i brought to the table (figuratively and literally). we wrap up after about another additional hour (2.5 hours total!) and i head back to the airport thinking i nailed it. we even talked about areas of atlanta i could look at moving to, moving assistance, and temporary housing while i looked for a place. they tell me they are interviewing another guy and i will know in about a week. \\n\\nso i get a call from my recruiter expecting good news. he tells me they went with the other guy and i'm crushed. he tells me they just wanted someone with a little more real world experience (i've heard this several times and it is beyond frustrating), and he leaves it at that. he tells me the other guy isn't a slam dunk because he has a small family to move and they weren't sure if he would accept, and i would be the guy if it falls through. it didn't fall through.\\n\\nit isn't until a few days later when i'm chatting with my recruiter about other possibilities and asking him to critique me as a candidate based on the feed back he has been getting (i had interviewed with 5 companies at this point, get furthest with the atlanta guys) and he drops the bomb that they thought i was dressed poorly! he quoted them as saying i \"looked like i was dressed to go to the mall\" and i wanted to shoot myself for not dressing up more. i could tell this was all coming from the coo and he most likely vetoed me because i didn't impress him with my atire. i was, and am still (it's been 2 months) crushed. and unemployed.\\n\\n \\n\\nedit: several people are commenting about the \"wear what you might wear to work\" idea. this came from my vocational background. i went to school to be an automotive technician before i went to art school for design. the idea behind that thinking is to \"look ready to start working immediatley\". obviously i realize now that this isn't appropriate for a corporate setting, but that was the idea behind it anyway.</td>\n",
       "      <td>the toy industry is laid back overall, and i assumed they would all be that way, but was rejected for not dressing formally enough in an interview by a c-level employee of the company i was interviewing for, even though i was a slam dunk with the guy i would have worked directly under.</td>\n",
