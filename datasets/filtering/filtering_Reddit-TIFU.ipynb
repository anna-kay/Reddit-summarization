       "      <td>tifu by trying to download diablo iii at work\\n\\nit started out like any other friday, with the regular flow of emails and support tickets getting handled fairly early on in the day.  with these distractions out of the way i set about my normal course of action for the end of the work week: browsing reddit and watching the occasional video on youtube. \\n\\nby midday myself and the other support team members noticed that a large number of cars were missing from the parking lot. one coworker had taken the day off to extend his weekend playing the new wow expansion, and it appeared that every other employee except the support team and head software engineer had gotten a head start on the long holiday weekend. \\n\\nin a stroke of genius, i came to the sudden realization that diablo iii could be played on mac os x (our office is primarily mac based). i shared this information with my boss  (who also happens to own diablo and is an avid work redditor), and half-jokingly suggested we both download a copy to our systems since our cubicles face out towards the hall, meaning our monitors are not in the public eye. \\n\\nhe was initially hesitant, as the head software engineer also oversees our servers, allowing him to monitor network activity if he so chose. we came to the conclusion that this was an unlikely possibility, as he has much more important tasks to take care of in his position. \\n\\nat this point, i eagerly began downloading battlenet to my computer, and my boss agreed to join me, opting to wait for my download to complete so that the could copy the directory files to his system so that we could minimize bandwidth usage. \\n\\nthings were going smoothly. \\n\\n2gb downloaded. \\n\\n4gb. \\n\\n6gb. \\n\\n8gb. \\n\\naround the 10gb mark, i get a message from a web developer (who i used to work  with in support) in the room next door who had returned from lunch.\\n\\n\"stop whatever you’re downloading”. “quick, stop now”. \\n\\nin mere seconds, the door to the support room opens, and low and behold, the head software engineer walks in with a slight smirk on his face. \\n\\n“hey, is anyone downloading a large file in here?” he asked.\\n\\n“uhhhhhhhhh….” was all i could muster in a high-pitched tone.  “maybe”.\\n\\t\\nhe followed with “is it work related?” \\n\\n“uhhhhhhhhh….” i replied again. “no….”\\n\\n“i don’t care”, he said. “but can you download on the wifi? i’m doing some work with the server”.\\n\\nahhh. sweet relief. i promptly uninstalled the portion i had downloaded to get rid of the evidence, and we had a good laugh in the support room. \\n\\n \\n\\t \\nedit: fixed the tl;dr.\\n\\nupdate:\\n\\nmere minutes later.  in the support room we somehow get on the topic of online and in person dating, as several guys on the team are single and one was flipping through tinder. my boss got on his case about going out to a bar with us so the tinder team member could meet people in person. \\n\\nwhen he said he couldn’t go, a joke was made about to chance of finding two girls, and me ending up with both of them since he couldn’t make it. another coworker chimes in with:\\n\\n“if there are ever groups of girls when you two are at a bar. call me.”\\n\\nanother joke is cracked as the conversation volume begins to escalate about the chances of a foursome being ruined if i call him. cue a message from friendly web developer next door:\\n\\n“we can hear every world ya’ll are saying. fyi”\\n\\nam i bad at my job? probably.</td>\n",
